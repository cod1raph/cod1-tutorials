# Improve gsc readability

To make it easier and more pleasant to read/write gsc, you can open the files using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Then, install the GSC extension by eyza, like that:

And confirm:

Now, when opening gsc files with Visual Stuio Code, to get the text colorized (and enable other features of the extension), you would have to accept this by clicking "Open":

The text should looks nice like that:

<img width="969" height="637" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-23 065549" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc28f69d-27cb-4561-944b-30c7ac190327" />

If sometimes, the text isn't colorized, you can click on "Restricted Mode" at the bottom left:

<img width="258" height="89" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-23 065855" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88430766-f49d-4135-aa9a-8f095e66bbfb" />

Then click "Trust":

<img width="407" height="325" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-23 065950" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7335a92c-4d29-4562-8856-e3ce48e9d2f4" />

Now you can go back to your file tab, the text will be colorized.
