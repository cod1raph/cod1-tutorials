pk3 files are zip archives but with the pk3 extension.

They contain files required for the client, such as images.

## Browsing

You can browse them, and modify their content without needing to extract them, for that, you need to install [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

Here is how browsing looks:

## Creating

First, be sure to make your File Explorer display "File name extensions", like this:

<img width="602" height="604" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-22 235915" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf803134-3d34-43e7-bf1e-1456f93adf2e" />

Now, let's take an empty folder, it will be the content of our pk3.  
First, compress it to zip file, like this:

Then, rename it, replacing `.zip` by `.pk3`, and confirm, like this:

## Adding files

To add files to your pk3, open the pk3 with 7-Zip, then just drag your file (or folder) into the window, then confirm:

## Updating files

To update/replace files in your pk3, do just like explained above for adding files: drag it at the same location as the old one, then confirm.

## Prioritize a pk3 by client

The client loads pk3 files by reverse alphabetical order: `qak.pk3` has priority over `pak.pk3`, so just rename your pk3 accordingly.
